IPSAE Project ToDo List
=====================

Phase 2: File Scanner Implementation
----------------------------------
[ ] Implement file validation in scanner.py:
    [ ] _is_valid_structure_file: Check PDB file format and content
    [ ] _is_valid_pae_file: Validate PAE JSON structure and matrix dimensions
[ ] Add error handling for malformed files
[ ] Add support for custom file naming patterns
[ ] Add progress reporting for large directories
[ ] Add tests for the scanner module
[ ] Add documentation for the scanner module

Phase 3: Visualization Tools
--------------------------
[ ] Create visualization module:
    [ ] Implement PyMOL script generation
    [ ] Add support for different visualization styles
    [ ] Add chain and residue coloring options
[ ] Create visualization command-line tool
[ ] Add tests for visualization module
[ ] Add documentation for visualization tools

Phase 4: Project Integration
--------------------------
[ ] Create main project script that combines:
    [ ] File scanning
    [ ] IPSAE calculation
    [ ] Visualization generation
[ ] Add configuration file support
[ ] Add command-line interface
[ ] Add progress reporting
[ ] Add error handling and logging
[ ] Add tests for the integrated workflow

Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
--------------------------------
[ ] Add comprehensive test suite:
    [ ] Unit tests for all modules
    [ ] Integration tests
    [ ] Example data and test cases
[ ] Improve documentation:
    [ ] API documentation
    [ ] User guide
    [ ] Installation instructions
    [ ] Example workflows
[ ] Add CI/CD pipeline
[ ] Add code coverage reporting

Phase 6: Optimization and Polish
------------------------------
[ ] Optimize performance:
    [ ] Profile code
    [ ] Optimize file scanning
    [ ] Optimize calculations
[ ] Add caching for repeated operations
[ ] Improve error messages and user feedback
[ ] Add support for parallel processing
[ ] Add support for batch processing

Future Enhancements
------------------
[ ] Add support for different file formats
[ ] Add support for different scoring methods

[ ] Add support for different output formats
[ ] Add support for different input sources
[ ] Add support for different calculation methods
[ ] Add support for different validation methods
[ ] Add support for different file naming conventions
[ ] Add support for different directory structures
[ ] Add support for different operating systems

Notes:
- Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Each task should be documented and tested
- Each feature should be user-tested
- Each phase should have a clear deliverable
- Each phase should have a clear success criteria
- Each phase should have a clear timeline
- Each phase should have a clear scope
- Each phase should have a clear budget
- Each phase should have a clear team
- Each phase should have a clear owner
